      <p>Physarum Connections reflects the joint efforts of Lindsay and Sara to make a difference in the world around them. Sara does the website stuff and Lindsay does the social media stuff and together they try to help the people around them do whatever it is they do best.</p>
      <p>Physarum polycephalum is a species of slime mold. Slime molds are great at finding and building connections really efficiently. We strive to be just as awesome at creating online communities.</p>
      <p>Sara is a web developer who loves making custom WordPress themes and beautiful single page sites. She wants your site to be accessible, maintainable, and easily found through search engines (aka have awesome SEO). She loves tidepools and is a proud Ravenclaw! </p>
      <p>Lindsay caught the social media bug when we started Whale Tales and loves the challenge of organizing multiple social media accounts and platforms. She thrives on being organized, making lists, and showing her Hufflepuff pride! </p>
