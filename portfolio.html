          <p><a href="http://whale-tales.org" target="new">Whale Tales</a> is an online community and website cofounded by three best friends, two of whom run Physarum Connections. In our first year and a half, we gained over 1100 followers on <a href="http://instagram.com/whaletalesorg">Instagram</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/whaletalesorg">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/whaletalesorg">Twitter</a>. We consistently get over 100 likes per Instagram post and engage with around 1500 people each week through Facebook.</p>
           <p>The site was built using Wordpress, and is now home to over one hundred stories about whales, dolphins and porpoises. We also use the site and social media to spread relevant calls to action with our followers and to share conservation stories and news from around the world.</p>

          <p><a href="http://saturnamarineresearch.ca">The Saturna Island Marine Conservation and Education Society</a> had a well-designed website that was in need of maintenance and more regular updates. They also wanted to have a more vigourous social media presence to help inform Saturna Island residents and visitors about their events and the interesting science happening on the island.</p>

          <p>We fully transformed the code of the site, but kept the photo-focused design intact. The website is now mobile-friendly and easily updated. With a stronger <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Saturna-Island-Marine-Research-Education-Society-128561124003052/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/simresbc/">Instagram</a> presence, SIMRES events and news are shared with a growing audience.</p>

          <img src="./images/portfolio-cinderella.jpg" alt="Screencap of the Cinderella Project website">
          <p><a href="http://thecinderellaproject.com">The Cinderella Project</a> works to encourage and recognize outstanding young people from across the Lower Mainland who reach the milestone of graduation despite overwhelming adversity. It was founded in 1999 and in 2014, Physarum Connections worked with them to create a brand-new website. The site now runs using Wordpress, which has made it easy to create new photo galleries, collect PayPal donations, and share the amazing stories of the students they help.</p>

          <p>The website and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cinderellaprojectsociety">social media</a> are important parts of The Cinderella Project’s mission as they help to keep participants, volunteers, and potential donors up to date on the Society’s activities and continuing mission.</p>

          <p>Dane at <a href="http://gpocharters.com">GPO Charters</a> contacted us to create a mobile-friendly website. As a small company, GPO Charters needed a solution that worked with the existing site that Dane had created. The new site looks the same on desktop, but has better SEO, will be more maintainable in the future, and looks great on mobile devices. </p>
